# Test Fixtures

## "Test-Per-Type"

That is one test class per class in the SUT.

| SUT | Test Class |
| -- | --- |
| Customer | CustomerTests |
| Policy | PolicyTests |

This is a hold-over from limitations of JUNit.

## Scenario-Based

That is a test class for each use-case, or even business rule of the SUT.
